A webapp with the few sample of my works. It also provides extra functionality that allows users to leave a hiring message hence gives only the admin access to view all message.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project on your machine, take the following steps. Clone the project, run npm install to install all packages. run npm start to start the project and run npm test for testing the API.

### Prerequisites

To be able to run the above commands, you need to have nodejs and node package manager installed on your machine. By default, once you install node, npm is also installed along side with it. So you dont need a special installation for npm. 

### Test

```
Run npm test or npm run test
```
